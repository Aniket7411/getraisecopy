                <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What Are Cloud Services?</h2>
                <p className="text-base md:text-md text-justify">
                    Have you ever uploaded a file on Google Drive or registered for a Zoom or any other online meeting without caring about where the data is stored? Behind the scenes is a cloud service. Just like an engine that drives a car in the background, cloud services are constantly working in the background. Literally, they are not flying in the sky, but they certainly bring the business organizations to new operational heights.</p>
                <p className="text-base md:text-md text-justify">
                    Cloud services refer to an array of tools sitting high up in the clouds that provide storage, computing capability, and software through the Internet. No cables. No bulky hardware. Not just a powerful technology anytime, anywhere, but strictly on the go! Today's organizations do not own all expensive properties; they lease whatever they need, similar to how people book hotels. It's fast, flexible, and cost-effective. </p>
                <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How Do Cloud Services Work?</h2>
                <p className="text-base md:text-md text-justify">
                    The cloud service looks like magic, but there is how it works:</p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 mb-2 space-y-2">
                    <li>
                        <strong>✔	Public Cloud:  </strong>A large-scale distributed computer running on the servers of giants such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Services, or Microsoft Azure. It’s available to everyone, can accommodate all sizes of organizations, and is suitable for most enterprises.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>✔	Private Cloud:  </strong> Think VIP access. This is not the public cloud, which is open to any party, but rather an environment built specifically for one business.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>✔	Hybrid Cloud:  </strong>The best of both worlds. While some data is stored in a private cloud, all the other types benefit from the advantages of the ever-open public cloud.
                    </li>

                            <strong>Data Storage & Backup: </strong> Social media networks such as Dropbox and Google Drive enable users to store, transfer, and even share files in real-time.

                        <li>
                            <strong>AI & Big Data: </strong> Behind these Voice Assistants, Anti-Fraud Systems, and every cloud-based big data solution, remote servers are churning through data at unprecedented speeds.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Remote Work: </strong> Applications such as Zoom, Slack, and Google Meet are cloud-based solutions that help connect the workforce around the globe seamlessly.

                        <p>
                            The era of cloud technology has only just begun; in fact, it is only getting started. Glimpses of the future include serverless computing,
                            which allows developers just to write code, and the rest of the infrastructure will be managed by the system like a kitchen that cleans
                            itself. Next is edge computing, which processes data nearer to where it is collected to minimize delay, significantly impacting real-time
                            applications like self-driving cars and smart devices. Quantum cloud computing, though still in its infancy, promises processing speeds
                            that were once considered fantasy.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-2">
                            Therefore, it can be said: "The sky is not the end—it is just the beginning for the cloud!"
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Ethical Issues in Cloud & AI Services</h3>
                        <p>
                            With great power comes great responsibility. Laws such as GDPR help prevent the exploitation of people's data. Businesses must avoid
                            the 'lock-in' effect, where changing service providers becomes nearly impossible. Sustainability is also a concern for cloud
                            infrastructures; many providers are now using power-efficient centers for the future.
                        </p>
