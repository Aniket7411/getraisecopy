                    Imagine a machine or an automatic device that performs tasks ranging from essay writing
                    to art creation and musical composition as well as homework assistance for students.
                    Welcome to the era of Generative AI - a technology that makes machines do more than just
                    calculations.

                <p className="text-base md:text-md text-justify mt-2">
                    Generative AI is a kind of artificial intelligence technology that learns from vast
                    amounts of examples and then utilizes that information to create new content. It provides
                    fresh and new human-like content. Because of these advantages, AI in assignment writing
                    has become a game-changer.
